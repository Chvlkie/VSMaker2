VS Maker 2 is a C# WinForms app for Generation IV Pokémon DS games, including Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver. Built with .NET Framework 8, it lets you easily edit Trainers, Trainer Classes, and Battle Messages.

**Features:**

- **Edit and Add Trainers:** Customise names, party Pokémon, levels, items, and even add new trainers for a unique gameplay experience. Adding new Trainers will also add their Trainer Script for more Eye-contact encounters.
- **Modify and Create Trainer Classes:** Create new classes or tweak existing ones, change class gender, encounter music and prize money values.
- **Personalise Battle Messages:** Change in-game battle texts. Edit the Trainer Text tables to change the triggers of each Trainer's battle messages. You can import/export this table as a .csv for even quicker editing!
- **Advanced ROM Patching:** Patch the ROM to increase Trainer name length, expand prize money tables, class gender tables, and encounter music tables, allowing for deeper customisation. WARNING: These patches are for advanced users and may break compatability with other tools. For example the Eye Contact encounter expansion causes incompatability with DSPRE's built in trainer editor.
- **Compatible with DSPRE:** Works with ROMs extracted using DSPRE.
